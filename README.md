# hcks dotfiles
these are my dotfiles for use with endeavourOS and hyprland

package "list" is provided as well

install using `stow dots`  
if not working:
1. `stow --adopt dots`
2. `git restore .`
3. `stow dots`

## nvim
my nvim config (just lazyvim for now) is stored in `nvim/`, load using same commands but with `nvim` instead of `dots`
